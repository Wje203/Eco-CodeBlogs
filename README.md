# WILLIAM ECONOMIC & CODING BLOGS
#### Video Demo:  
#### Description:

My name is William. I love coding and I'm a big fan of economics. I used this opportunity to launch my blogs for coding and economics. This final project's topic is an economic analysis of the 2008 financial crisis. I wrote a blog regarding its causes, effects, and potential reappearance. My website is only getting started. More stuff for the economic analysis and my journey into coding will be added. It's simply a basic blog site right now.

Let's start by discussing the user experience.

The subtitle "Economic Analysis and Coding Journey" makes it clear to the user what my website is meant to do. Without having to open a "About" page, they can easily read my profile on the left side of the page. Today's designs tend to feature larger images and shorter text; I followed this trend when creating the index for each of my new posts. Later, we'll talk about each post. The "Recent Post" box is shown on the side and allows users to quickly get to the post they want to view without having to scroll down a lot. There is a "tags" section below that. The tag for "Economics" is now active. Although there isn't a post yet if you click the coding tag, the link provided makes it simple to get back to the index page.

I made it a little bit simpler for the user to navigate. For the sections "Why it happened," "How it changed the world",Â and "Who was affected," I inserted an HTML link bookmark to the blog article "Financial Crisis of 2008: Its Causes and Effects." In addition, I included a link to the YouTube video "The Untold Story of the 2008 Financial Crisis." Simple text and photos make up the remainder. By using the "return" button, the user can quickly go back to the index page. Additionally, each page has a "Send me to the top" button.

Let's now discuss the code.

I believe the w3schools documentations are the most straightforward for me to use and learn web development, thus I choose them. I heavily included HTML components and dependencies from Google Fonts and w3schools. Because I thought it would be more simpler and better to create my website that way, I made the decision to insert the CSS file in the HTML file. Users are directed to each post page by the "Read More" buttons, which are Javascript on-click commands. I put the asset files in an asset folder, added comments to each code block, and made the code more aesthetically pleasing for neat and organized coding. Finally, I uploaded it and made it live on Netlify to display my portfolio to the world. I did this by linking my Netlify to my Github repository and uploading my files from my Visual Studio code to Github.

JavaScript and CSS are present in each and every HTML file. The homepage is "Index.html." The coding blogs will be placed under "Coding.html". The exact post is written in "cae.html" and "newop.html." They all have HTML tags like the head and body as well as the HTML, title, meta, and link for importing. hr, img, h5, ul, li, h4, br, footer, div, header, b, h3, span, p, a button where I utilize JavaScript for the on-click command.
