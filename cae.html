						<p>One of the greatest economic downturns in recent memory occurred during the financial crisis of 2008. The recession that followed the housing market meltdown was brought on by other reasons, including rising consumer debt. The causes, symptoms, and effects of this worldwide catastrophe are discussed in this blog post. </p>
						<h2 id="ref1">Why Did The Financial Crisis Happen?
              </h2>
						<p>Several causes contributed to the financial crisis of 2008, including such as the collapse of the property market. However, there wasn't just one thing to blame; rather, a number of factors contributed to the events of 2007–2008. These comprised: </p>
						<h3>Low Interest Rates:
              </h3> <img src="/assets/interest.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
						<p>which encouraged people to take out loans for homes they couldn't afford because house prices rose quickly between 2001 and 2006 as a result of lax lending standards on the part of banks combined with easy credit conditions. Subprime borrowing also increased from an annual rate of $85 billion in the 2000s decade to a peak of $600 billion in 2006. </p>
						<h3>European Bank Crisis
              </h3>
						<p>made it challenging for American banks, particularly investment banks like Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers who heavily invested in subprime mortgage backed securities (MBS) using borrowed money from overnight lenders such as "repo" markets where they used these toxic assets as collateralized by stocks or bonds of companies like Enron to borrow money. </p>
						<h3>Corporate governance mistakes
              </h3>
						<p>While some companies, like Bear Stearns, were more exposed than other investment banks because they didn't have enough cash on hand during the financial panic when they were unable to meet their obligations so creditors lost faith in them leading up to collapse & fire sale for pennies on dollar bankruptcy, CEOs had perverse incentives due to pay structure that encouraged them into taking excessive risks in the housing market. </p>
						<h3>Real estate Bubble Burst:
              </h3>
						<p>which caused a massive increase in home prices by 150 percent between 2001 and 2006, where the average American family could easily afford $200k homes but which became unsustainable after the 2006–2007 period with record low interest rates combined with risky loan products caused a massive increase in home prices.
							<h2 id="ref2">How Has The World Changed Since The 2008 Financial Crisis?
              </h2>
							<p>First, it had an impact on banks that were in trouble due to their exposure to US subprime mortgages and other toxic assets, which eventually caused bank failures due to liquidity problems, necessitating government bailouts. who took taxpayer money and printed more money, causing fears of hyperinflation even though at the time this was not the case. Hyperinflation fears still exist today, affecting currencies like the Euro, with the European Central Bank (ECB) printing €60 billion per month starting in 2015 and continuing through September 2016 while inflation is at its highest level since June 2013. </p> <img src="/assets/world.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
							<p>Second, it led to the "too big to fail" issue after Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, which had a domino effect on AIG, which was a significant insurance firm that covered 90 percent of the assets of large corporations. However, because AIG is a huge insurance firm that insures the assets of 90% of major banks worldwide, there was so much at stake that the American government was forced to bail them out as well and create additional money. </p>
							<p>Thirdly, it started with the US national debt skyrocketing from $19 trillion in 2008 to over $500 billion every year under the Obama presidency, bringing the total public debt to 19.91 trillion dollars or 106% of GDP, which is typically sustainable between 85 and 90%. </p>
							<p>Fourthly, this led to the deregulation of Wall Street because nothing has changed since then, and financial firms are now permitted to take even greater risks than they previously could because they are confident that their taxpayers would bail them out if anything goes wrong. </p>
							</h4>
							<h2 id="ref3">Who Was Affected by the Crisis?
            </h2>
							<p>Numerous millions of individuals were impacted by the catastrophe. First, it led to a significant increase in the unemployment rate, with jobless claims rising from 401k to over 650k between October 2007 and April 2009, when the US economy lost nearly $14 trillion in wealth, or about $50k per American household. This slow recovery and high debt levels throughout the Obama administration from 2009 to the present day, in 2017 are still affecting growth. The bottom 80 percent of earners lost a significant amount of net worth as a result of housing prices dropping by 30 percent after the bubble burst, mass layoffs beginning, and many Americans defaulting on their mortgages, leading to foreclosures and evictions across America. Second, this created a significant wealth gap between the top 20 percent of earners who actually increased their assets compared to before. </p>
							<h2>Conclusion
            </h2>
							<p>Because the American economy is still recuperating from the 2008 financial crisis, it was a significant turning point in world history that altered all we knew. </p>
