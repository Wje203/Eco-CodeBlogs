						<p>Numerous articles and comments have been published to commemorate the 2008 financial panic's tenth anniversary. But almost all of them neglect the weak dollar, which is what started the crisis. Economic upheavals always result from a shaky, unpredictable currency. If we fail to learn that important lesson, we will unavoidably encounter significant difficulties in the future. Additionally, their analyses downplay or ignore two additional significant errors made by the federal government. Here are the first three. </p>
						<h2 id="ref1">Dollar being damaged
              </h2>
						<p>The high-tech bubble burst, which caused the economy to decline in 2000, and the subsequent official recession that year. The Federal Reserve began lowering interest rates in response. The value of the dollar was subsequently undermined by it and the Treasury Department, which is legally in control of it. </p>
						<p>That was a terrible oversight. This action was justified on the grounds that increasing exports will help to stimulate the economy by gradually depreciating the value of the dollar. That idea is absurd because stable currencies consistently outperform unstable ones over the long term. Compare Argentina with Switzerland, which has had one of the worst managed currencies over the previous century. Argentina has stagnated despite once being a global economic powerhouse, while Switzerland has grown impressively. </p>
						<p>The cause of this stark difference is evident. Investment is essential to progress, and it is made much easier when the value of money is steady. Similarly, markets function much more effectively and productively when there are set weights and measures for goods. For instance, the volume of liquid that makes up a gallon is constant. The way a yardstick measures length is how money measures worth. </p> <img src="/assets/gold.png" alt="Nature" style="width:100%">
						<p>Funny money skews prices, which are the supply and demand-driven messengers of information that are essential necessary for open markets to operate. An informational corruption caused by a devalued currency is similar to a computer virus. Commodity prices rocketed as the dollar's value was being destroyed. From $20 to $25 a barrel to above $100, oil flooded out. Gold soared from less than $300 per ounce to a high of $1,900. People turn to hard assets when money becomes unstable. The housing market was the most shocking, catastrophic example of that dynamic. Other currencies broadly followed the disastrous example set by the dollar. As a result, the artificial housing boom and crisis spread globally. </p>
						<h2 id="ref2">Washington's ambiguity causes the financial markets to become paralyzed.
              </h2>
						<p>The impending reckoning descended into a panic that almost caused a catastrophic heart arrest in the financial system. With a substantial amount of subprime mortgages and other dubious assets, Wall Street's fifth-largest investment bank collapsed in the spring of 2008. Bear Stearns wasn't exactly a key institution, yet the Bush government nonetheless chose to support the creditors of the company. During that summer, the two politically influential and carelessly managed government-sponsored companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were stuffed with subprime mortgages, teetered. Washington stepped in to save them. After that, Washington permitted Lehman Brothers to fail, a much bigger and more significant institution than Bear Stearns. The demand was for "no bailouts ever again." After becoming overly aggressive, the first money market ever founded suffered losses. There was a run on money market funds, which had assets worth over $2 trillion. At the same time, AIG, the biggest commercial insurer in the world, required a substantial injection of emergency funds. </p>
						<p>Everyone desperately grasped their cash as panic broke out. Washington again made a U-turn, providing federal guarantees for money market funds and bank bailouts for certain institutions. In actuality, AIG and Citigroup were nationalized. </p>
						<h2 id="ref3">A simple accounting regulation was turned into a destructive weapon.
              </h2>
						<p>The "mark-to-market accounting" accounting regulation, which had been abandoned during the Great Depression, was revived by authorities in 2007. At a time when these institutions were in peril, it had the effect of continuously and mercilessly artificially depressing the value of bank capital. </p>
						<p>The Bush administration stubbornly denied that this edict was harmful. Thanks to the efforts of a few progressive people, the House of Representatives finally scheduled a hearing in early March 2009 that made it quite evident that this order had to be repealed. Regulators understood the message and successfully overturned the harmful rule that was endangering our financial system's very survival. The horrific bear market, which had pummeled equity averages by nearly 60%, came to an abrupt conclusion as a result. The ensuing bull market is still going strong today. </p>
						<p> This entire deplorable experience serves as a stark reminder of an overlooked truism: economic disasters are caused by governments, not free markets. </p>
